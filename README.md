## üìù Project Overview
This project provides a **data-driven sales analytics solution** for Northwind Traders. It focuses on exploring **customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends** to generate actionable business insights. The project leverages **SQL, Python, Excel, and PB (Power BI)** to extract, analyze, visualize, and interpret sales data for strategic decision-making.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement
Northwind Traders faced challenges in analyzing sales data efficiently. Key issues included:

- Lack of visibility into customer segmentation and purchase behavior.  
- Difficulty in identifying top-performing and low-performing products.  
- Limited insights into regional sales trends.  
- Reactive decision-making in inventory and marketing strategies.

This project addresses these challenges by creating a structured approach to **analyze, visualize, and interpret sales data**, enabling **data-driven decisions**.

   - SQL scripts (`SQL_Sales_Analytics.sql`) to extract and query data from the Northwind database.  
   - Dataset stored in `data/` folder for easy access and reproducibility.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Excel file (`EDA_Sales_Analytics.xlsx`) for detailed trend analysis, outlier detection, and sales patterns.  

3. **MECE Analysis**  
   - Structured MECE insights (`MECE_Sales_Analytics.docx`) to ensure comprehensive and non-overlapping findings.  

4. **Dashboards & Visualization**  
   - Interactive Power BI dashboards (`Dashboard_Sales_Analytics.pbix` and `Sales_Analytics.pbix`) to visualize KPIs, customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends.  

5. **Presentation & Reporting**  
   - PowerPoint presentation (`Sales_Analytics.pptx`) summarizing findings, insights, and actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
