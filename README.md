## Project Overview
This project provides a **data-driven sales analytics solution** for Northwind Traders. It focuses on exploring **customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends** to generate actionable business insights. The project leverages **SQL, Python, Excel, and PB (Power BI)** to extract, analyze, visualize, and interpret sales data for strategic decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Northwind Traders faced challenges in analyzing sales data efficiently. Key issues included:

- Lack of visibility into customer segmentation and purchase behavior.  
- Difficulty in identifying top-performing and low-performing products.  
- Limited insights into regional sales trends.  
- Reactive decision-making in inventory and marketing strategies.

This project addresses these challenges by creating a structured approach to **analyze, visualize, and interpret sales data**, enabling **data-driven decisions**.

   - Detailed analysis using Excel (`EDA_Sales_Analytics.xlsx`) to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.  
   - Insights on sales distribution, top products, customer activity, and regional performance.  

3. **MECE Analysis**  
   - Structured analysis documented in (`MECE_Sales_Analytics.docx`) to ensure comprehensive, non-overlapping insights.  
   - Categorization of findings into sales, customer, product, and market insights.  

4. **Dashboards & Visualization**  
   - Interactive dashboards in Power BI (`Dashboard_Sales_Analytics.pbix` and `Sales_Analytics.pbix`) for KPIs, regional trends, and product performance.  
   - Visual representation of actionable insights for management decision-making.  

5. **Presentation & Reporting**
